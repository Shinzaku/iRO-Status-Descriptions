# iRO-Status-Descriptions

In iRO today, there are a number of statuses that are either inconsistent in formatting, missing a description, or have wrong information.
Example:

![status-no-title](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4bb2d2c-310d-4bed-a6d1-08252e2113f4)

The goal is to provide descriptions that are hopefully more clear, and concise.
Standardized to:
- Status Title
- Timer
- Description

For descriptions, a particular order for statuses that affect skills will be used

[Skill Name] damage/effect increased/reduced

For status that pertain to stats (STR, DEX, etc)

Increased/reduced [stat name]

This is to ensure quick and standard readability to know when a skill is affected, vs a stat, and consistency in regards to how it is affected. For statuses that have a static effect (certain consumables), the description may have the amounts added in. Otherwise, generic text will be used as those values can vary depending on consumable, skill level, etc.

New lines will be carried over and indented if the sentence seems too long
