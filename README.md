# iRO-Status-Descriptions
_Up to date as of September 16, 2025 maintenance_

In iRO today, there are a number of statuses that are either inconsistent in formatting, missing a description or title, or have wrong information.
Example:

![status-no-title](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4bb2d2c-310d-4bed-a6d1-08252e2113f4)

The goal is to provide descriptions that are hopefully more clear, and concise.
Standardized to:
- Status Title
- Timer
- Description

For descriptions, a particular order will be attempted:

[Skill Name/Stat] damage/effect increased/decreased

This is to ensure quick and standard readability to know when a skill or stat is affected and how. For statuses that have a static effect (certain consumables), the description may have the amounts added in. Otherwise, generic text will be used as those values can vary depending on consumable, skill level, etc.

New lines will be carried over and indented if the sentence seems too long 

![status-goal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b642f79c-b9e7-4d1b-b26d-5290ed29504d)

If I am missing a status description, please open an issue and I'll attempt to add it to the next release. There are a number of effects that have an EFST id but don't have an icon and description in the game files.

**You will need a GRF Editor to manually merge the releases.**
