# iRO-Status-Descriptions

In iRO today, there are a number of statuses that are either inconsistent in formatting, missing a description, or have wrong information.
The goal is to provide descriptions that are hopefully more clear, and concise.

You will need a GRF Editor to manually merge the releases.
