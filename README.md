# iRO-Status-Descriptions

In iRO today, there are a number of statuses that are either inconsistent in formatting, missing a description, or have wrong information.
Example:

![status-no-title](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4bb2d2c-310d-4bed-a6d1-08252e2113f4)

The goal is to provide descriptions that are hopefully more clear, and concise.
Standardized to:
- Status Title
- Timer
- Description

For descriptions, a particular order for statuses that affect skills will be used

[Skill Name] damage/effect increased/reduced

For status that pertain to stats (STR, DEX, etc)

Increased/reduced [stat name]

This is to ensure quick and standard readability to know when a skill is affected, vs a stat, and consistency in regards to how it is affected
